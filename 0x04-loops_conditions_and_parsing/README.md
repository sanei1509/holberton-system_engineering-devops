name of the project â†’ ****0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O****
<br>

## Background Context
this project is destined to be in pairs, we must program it both

**These are the concept that we wiil see:**

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/bUxwUIRhI1ehqqr1UF3HaA "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

### General

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

##More Info
Data Structure and Functions used

````c
````

``print_array``, and ``print_list`` functions:

````c
void print_array(const int *array, size_t size)
{
    size_t i;

    i = 0;
    while (array && i < size)
    {
        if (i > 0)
}
````
To print the elements worked in the algorithm with ``LISTS``
````c
void print_list(const listint_t *list)
{
    int i;
````
